**This is just a mirror**

The point of this repo is to prove the `nofib-analyse` package on hackage, to
allow them to run `cabal install nofib-analyse`, for example when they don't
have a checkout of GHC around – pure convenience.

I occasionally copy the state of `nofib-analyse` in GHC into this
repository, and make the necessary adjustments to make it fit for a release to
hackage. Feel free to ping me if you need this.

Development of `nofib-analyse` should happen in
[GHC’s nofib/ repository](http://git.haskell.org/nofib.git).
